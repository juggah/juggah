## Introduction

I work as a freelance IT Coonsultant with a focus on Azure Cloud Infrastucture Solutions and Network Design & Engineering. And all the intersections inbetween. You will find a little bit of code here and articles related to the design and configuration of Azure Products and network components that are directly connected to it.
